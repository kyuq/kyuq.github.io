excerpt: 'Immersive Virtual Reality can be a memorable medium for storytelling and artistic expression. However, taking snapshots of VR applications is commonly only possible by taking a two-dimensional screenshot on a tethered PC. We propose to capture 3D snapshots using the interaction technique World-In-Miniature (WiM) by using virtual RGB-D cameras to create three-dimensional snapshots that can be exported and viewed outside the application. We further describe a novel interaction method to fine-tune the content shown inside the WiM with VR controllers. This project is open-source and can be accessed at https://github.com/kyuq/3DWiMSnapshot'
