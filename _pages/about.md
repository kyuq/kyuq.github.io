I am a researcher at MedPhoton GmbH and a Ph.D. student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My research activities focus on 3D User Interfaces (3DUI) and Interaction Paradigms for Mixed Reality systems, including Virtual and Augmented Reality. My aim is to deploy intuitive 3DUI methods in Healthcare. In particular, since surgeries often still rely on outdated technology and cumbersome systems, it is my personal goal to discover and evaluate novel ideas and introduce them into the actual operating room.

My projects included Mixed Reality systems ranging from medical education, physical rehabilitation, teleconsultation, intra-operative guidance, and medical image visualization. This landing page will provide you with a comprehensive list of my work.
