title: "Duplicated Reality for Co-located Augmented Reality Collaboration"

excerpt: "When two or more users attempt to collaborate in the same space with Augmented Reality, they often encounter conflicting intentions regarding the occupation of the same working area and self-positioning around such without mutual interference. Augmented Reality is a powerful tool for communicating ideas and intentions during a co-assisting task that requires multi-disciplinary expertise. To relax the constraint of physical co-location, we propose the concept of Duplicated Reality, where a digital copy of a 3D region of interest of the users' environment is reconstructed in real-time and visualized in-situ through an Augmented Reality user interface. This enables users to remotely annotate the region of interest while being co-located with others in Augmented Reality. We perform a user study to gain an in-depth understanding of the proposed method compared to an in-situ augmentation, including collaboration, effort â€¦"

When two or more users attempt to collaborate in the same space with Augmented Reality, they often encounter conflicting intentions regarding the occupation of the same working area and self-positioning around such without mutual interference. Augmented Reality is a powerful tool for communicating ideas and intentions during a co-assisting task that requires multi-disciplinary expertise. To relax the constraint of physical co-location, we propose the concept of Duplicated Reality, where a digital copy of a 3D region of interest of the users' environment is reconstructed in real-time and visualized in-situ through an Augmented Reality user interface. This enables users to remotely annotate the region of interest while being co-located with others in Augmented Reality. We perform a user study to gain an in-depth understanding of the proposed method compared to an in-situ augmentation, including collaboration, effort, awareness, usability, and the quality of the task. The result indicates almost identical objective and subjective results, except a decrease in the consulting user's awareness of co-located users when using our method. The added benefit from duplicating the working area into a designated consulting area opens up new interaction paradigms to be further investigated for future co-located Augmented Reality collaboration systems.
