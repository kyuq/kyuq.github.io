title: "Clean-AR: Using Augmented Reality for Reducing the Risk of Contamination from Airborne Disease Agents on Surfaces"

excerpt: 'A core principle of modern health care is the compliance of hygienic and aseptic techniques in areas that are sensitive to contamination through bacteria, dust, aerosols, and fallout, primarily in operating theatres or around patients with contagious diseases. Keeping track of potentially contaminated surfaces in an environment is a major concern, especially when protecting from COVID-19. This work proposes a novel concept in using 3D sensing technology to track human movement within an indoor area and identifying high-risk contaminated surfaces in real-time. It combines recent Augmented Reality display technology, which allows keeping track of decontaminated surfaces during the cleaning process using an interactive visualization method. The proposed concept of Clean- AR is implemented in a clinical environment used for observation in COVID-19 scenarios. We discuss key challenges and outline â€¦'

A core principle of modern health care is the com-pliance of hygienic and aseptic techniques in areas that are sensitive  to  contamination  through  bacteria,  dust,  aerosols,  and fallout, primarily in operating theatres or around patients with contagious  diseases.  Keeping  track  of  potentially  contaminated surfaces in an environment is a major concern, especially when protecting from COVID-19. This work proposes a novel concept in using 3D sensing technology to track human movement within an in door area and identifying high-risk contaminated surfaces in real-time. It combines recent Augmented Reality display technology, which allows keeping track of decontaminated surfaces during the cleaning process using an interactive visualization method. The proposed concept of Clean-AR is implemented in a clinical environment used for observation  in  COVID-19  scenarios. We  discuss  key  challenges  and outline  further  research  direction  in  effectively  reducing  the risk of contamination using the proposed concept.
