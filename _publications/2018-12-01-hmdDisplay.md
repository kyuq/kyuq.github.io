excerpt: 'When two or more users attempt to collaborate in the same space with Augmented Reality, they often encounter conflicting intentions regarding the occupation of the same working area and self-positioning around such without mutual interference. Augmented Reality is a powerful tool for communicating ideas and intentions during a co-assisting task that requires multi-disciplinary expertise. To relax the constraint of physical co-location, we propose the concept of Duplicated Reality, where a digital copy of a 3D region of interest of the users\' environment is reconstructed in real-time and visualized in-situ through an Augmented Reality user interface. This enables users to remotely annotate the region of interest while being co-located with others in Augmented Reality. We perform a user study to gain an in-depth understanding of the proposed method compared to an in-situ augmentation, including collaboration, effort …'

Background and purpose 
Optical see-through head mounted displays (OST-HMDs) offer a mixed reality (MixR) experience with unhindered procedural site visualization during procedures using high resolution radiographic imaging. This technical note describes our preliminary experience with percutaneous spine procedures utilizing OST-HMD as an alternative to traditional angiography suite monitors.

Methods 
MixR visualization was achieved using the Microsoft HoloLens system. Various spine procedures (vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, and percutaneous discectomy) were performed on a lumbar spine phantom with commercially available devices. The HMD created a real time MixR environment by superimposing virtual posteroanterior and lateral views onto the interventionalist’s field of view. The procedures were filmed from the operator’s perspective. Videos were reviewed to assess whether key anatomic landmarks and materials were reliably visualized. Dosimetry and procedural times were recorded. The operator completed a questionnaire following each procedure, detailing benefits, limitations, and visualization mode preferences.

Results 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty, and discectomy procedures were successfully performed using OST-HMD image guidance on a lumbar spine phantom. Dosimetry and procedural time compared favorably with typical procedural times. Conventional and MixR visualization modes were equally effective in providing image guidance, with key anatomic landmarks and materials reliably visualized.

Conclusion 
This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing OST-HMDs for image guidance in interventional spine procedures. This novel visualization approach may serve as a valuable adjunct tool during minimally invasive percutaneous spine treatment.
